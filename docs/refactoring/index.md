# Refactoring Journey 🔄

## Overview

This section documents our refactoring journey as we evolved from a simple layered architecture to a sophisticated event-driven, multi-currency financial system. Each refactor was driven by real business needs and technical challenges.

## Key Refactoring Milestones

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture 🔄

**Status**: ✅ **Completed**

Our final architecture that decouples currency conversion from payment processing and business validation.

**Key Design Decisions**:

- **Decoupled Currency Conversion**: Pure, reusable service with no side effects
- **Business Validation After Conversion**: All checks performed in account's native currency
- **Payment Triggered by Business Validation**: Not by conversion completion
- **Event Chaining Pattern**: Clear flow of dependent operations

**Benefits Achieved**:

- ✅ Correct multi-currency validation
- ✅ Reusable conversion logic
- ✅ No if-statements for control flow
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Flexible payment triggers

### 2. Lessons Learned 📚

**Status**: ✅ **Completed**

Documentation of key problems solved and design decisions that led to our final architecture.

**Key Insights**:

- Currency conversion should be pure and reusable
- Business validation must happen after conversion
- Event chaining eliminates if-statements
- Payment should be triggered by business validation

### 7. Event-Driven Transfer Flow 🔄

**Status**: ✅ **Completed**

Implemented event-driven architecture for internal transfers between accounts.

**Key Features**:

- Source and target validation
- Currency conversion
- Domain transfer operations
- Transactional consistency

**Key Changes**:

- Separated read and write operations
- Optimized queries
- Improved performance
- Better scalability

Refactored transaction persistence to use proper repository pattern with Unit of Work.

**Key Improvements**:

- Consistent persistence logic
- Transactional operations
- Better error handling
- Improved testability

### 11. Layered Dependency Injection 🏛️

**Status**: ✅ **Completed**

Implemented proper dependency injection across all layers of the application.

**Key Benefits**:

- Loose coupling
- Easy testing
- Clear dependencies
- Maintainable code

## Architecture Evolution

### Before Refactoring

```text
Simple Layered Architecture
├── Controllers
├── Services
├── Repositories
└── Database
```

### After Refactoring

```
Event-Driven Clean Architecture
├── Event Bus
├── Event Handlers
├── Domain Services
├── Repositories (with UoW)
├── Infrastructure
└── Cross-cutting Concerns (Decorators)
```

## Key Principles Established

### 1. Event-Driven Design

- **Events as First-Class Citizens**: All business operations emit events
- **Event Chaining**: Dependent operations flow through events
- **Decoupled Handlers**: Each handler has a single responsibility

### 2. Clean Architecture

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Business logic in domain layer
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers

### 3. Multi-Currency Support

- **Currency Conversion**: Pure, reusable service
- **Business Validation**: Always in account's native currency
- **Flexible Payment**: Triggered by business validation

### 4. Testing Excellence

- **Unit Tests**: Each component tested in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end event flow testing
- **Mock Dependencies**: Easy to mock external services

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Maintainability

- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to modify individual components
- Well-documented architecture
- Consistent patterns

### 2. Testability

- Each component can be tested in isolation
- Mock dependencies easily injected
- Event-driven testing patterns
- Clear test boundaries

### 3. Scalability

- Handlers can be scaled independently
- Event bus can be distributed
- Easy to add new business operations
- No tight coupling

### 4. Flexibility

- New currencies can be added without changing business logic
- New payment providers can be integrated easily
- Business rules can be modified independently
- Clear extension points

### 5. Observability

- Clear event flow for debugging
- Structured logging at each step
- Audit trail of all operations
- Easy to monitor and alert

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation

1. Implement clean architecture principles
2. Add dependency injection
3. Introduce repository pattern with Unit of Work

### Phase 2: Event-Driven

1. Implement event bus
2. Create event-driven handlers
3. Add event chaining patterns

### Phase 3: Multi-Currency

1. Implement currency conversion service
2. Add multi-currency validation
3. Decouple conversion from payment

### Phase 4: Optimization

1. Implement CQRS for transactions
2. Add caching and performance optimizations
3. Improve error handling and observability

## Final Architecture Summary

Our final architecture is a **sophisticated event-driven, multi-currency financial system** that:

- ✅ **Decouples concerns** through event-driven design
- ✅ **Handles multi-currency** operations correctly
- ✅ **Maintains consistency** through Unit of Work pattern
- ✅ **Scales effectively** through clean separation
- ✅ **Tests thoroughly** through dependency injection
- ✅ **Observes clearly** through structured logging

This architecture provides a solid foundation for future growth while maintaining clean separation of concerns and enabling easy extension of business operations.

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**: Track system performance and optimize as needed
2. **Add New Features**: Use established patterns for new business operations
3. **Improve Observability**: Add metrics, tracing, and alerting
4. **Scale Infrastructure**: Consider distributed event bus for high load
5. **Document Patterns**: Continue documenting best practices and patterns

The refactoring journey has transformed our codebase from a simple layered application to a sophisticated, event-driven, multi-currency financial system that is maintainable, testable, scalable, and flexible.
