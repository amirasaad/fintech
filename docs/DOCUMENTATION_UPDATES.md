## ðŸŽ¯ Key Corrections Made

### Event Flow Accuracy
- **Before:** Documentation showed incorrect event sequences
- **After:** Event flows now match the actual implementation in E2E tests

### Event Names
- **Before:** Used outdated or incorrect event names
- **After:** All event names match the current `pkg/domain/events/` definitions

### Handler Structure
- **Before:** Referenced non-existent handlers or incorrect responsibilities
- **After:** Accurately describes current handler implementations in `pkg/handler/`

### File Paths
- **Before:** Incorrect paths to source files
- **After:** All paths point to actual files in the current codebase

### Implementation Details
- **Before:** Generic or outdated code examples
- **After:** Actual code patterns and structures from current implementation

## ðŸ§ª Verification

All documentation updates were verified against:

1. **Current source code** in `pkg/domain/events/`
2. **Handler implementations** in `pkg/handler/`
3. **E2E test flows** in `pkg/handler/e2e_event_flow_test.go`
4. **Actual project structure** and file organization

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks

The following areas may need future attention:

1. **API Documentation:** OpenAPI specs may need updates if endpoints changed
2. **Payment Integration Docs:** May need updates if Stripe integration changed
3. **Currency System Docs:** May need updates if currency handling changed
4. **Testing Documentation:** Could be expanded with new test patterns

## ðŸŽ‰ Benefits

These updates provide:

- **Accurate Reference:** Developers can trust the documentation
- **Better Onboarding:** New team members get correct information
- **Maintenance Clarity:** Clear understanding of current architecture
- **Testing Guidance:** Accurate examples for writing tests
- **Event Flow Understanding:** Correct event sequences for debugging

## ðŸ“š Next Steps

1. **Regular Reviews:** Schedule periodic documentation reviews
2. **Automated Checks:** Consider adding documentation validation to CI/CD
3. **Living Documentation:** Keep docs updated with code changes
4. **Feedback Loop:** Encourage team feedback on documentation accuracy
